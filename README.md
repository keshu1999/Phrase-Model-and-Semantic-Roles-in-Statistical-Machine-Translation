### Abstract
Text Translation is one of the essential aspects of the world of the web. Machine translation is such a vital part of the web as it is time-efficient, relatively cheap, and, most importantly, can translate text across many languages. With the amount of information expanding, the number of internet users increasing, and Artificial Intelligence powering the world, it became necessary for the quality of translation to also improve. This paper presents some techniques used in the process of Machine translation. Furthermore, it also presents how machine translation has improved over the years and also proposes specific ways that can enhance the process of translation.
